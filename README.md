# odin-library

This is a project in TheOdinProjects JS curriculum utilizing Javascript to create a library app, in order to track books you have read and books you may want to read in the future. 

Not much styling was done, but layout and styling that is present was accomplished through Bootstrap.

Book objects were created using a book constructor, in order to track specific attributes for each book. They were then placed in a library array for storage purposes.

I hadn't utilized Javascript much during my past projects, choosing to instead rely upon either Rails, Bootstrap, Custom CSS, or plugins, so I was a bit rusty at the beginning of this. But managing to create a page nearly entirely populated through JS additions , allowing me to write very little HTML and my app to function alot cleaner.

In the future, I will come back to this project and add local storage, allowing the library to persist on page refresh. I have utilized local storage in the past, when I was a much worse programmer, so I am curious to see how much easier it is to use now. Additionally, I will create much better styling as well, so that this can be a neat toy project to put on my portfolio instead of just a project to flex my muscles.
